# Hi, I'm Franciszek Kaczmarek ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Data Scientist and Machine Learning enthusiast with a passion for building innovative solutions using data. I specialize in deep learning, computer vision, and data analysis. Currently, I'm pursuing a Master's degree in Data Science and Society at Tilburg University, and I have experience in applying machine learning in real-world projects.

## Skills
- **Programming Languages**: Python, R
- **Data Science & Machine Learning**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, 
- **Computer Vision**: YOLO models - ultralytics, OpenCV
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Tools**: Git, Jupyter, SQL, Excel, Bash

## Projects
### [YOLOv10 Nodule Detection](https://github.com/your-username/yolov10-nodule-detection)
A custom object detection model built using YOLOv10, focused on detecting nodules in medical images. This project involved training a custom single-class dataset and achieving high accuracy in real-time detection. After that it excelled in lung nodules classification using 3D CNN.

### [Pipeline to determine good chess moves determinants](https://github.com/franekaczmarek/chess_ACPL_analysis_with_linear_regression)
This project demonstrates the analysis of chess games using R and a chess engine. The focus is on calculating the Average Centipawn Loss (ACPL), which represents the accuracy of chess moves in a given game. Additionally, the project applies linear regression models and various statistical tests to examine the determinants of ACPL, providing insights into factors influencing the precision of chess moves.


## Experience
- **Deep Learning & Data Analysis Intern** at **AstraZeneca**  
  Worked on implementing deep learning models and building Power BI reports to analyze large datasets and extract meaningful insights for business decision-making.

- **Data Science Intern** at **Selectivv**  
  Developed Python scripts to automate data analysis and streamline operations. Delivered actionable insights from real-time data using advanced analytics.

## Education
- **Master's in Data Science and Society** - Tilburg University (2024)
- **Bachelor's in Quantitative Methods in Economics and Information Systems** - SGH Warsaw School of Economics (2023)
